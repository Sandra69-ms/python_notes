EG: MySQL,oracile

Importance of SQL in dataset

2,Foundation of data management

sql is standard lamnguage for managing and manipulating relational database
it allows for efficent Querry updating and managing of data stored in relational database


3,Data extraction

SQLenables the extraction of revelent data from large dataset
Analyse and data scientist use SQL to filter aggregate and transform data to gain insights.


4,data manipulation

SQL allows for creation , updating, and deleation of data reccords.
It provide robust functions for data clening and preperation which are crucial steps in data analysis


5,integration with data tools

SQL integrate seamlesily with various data analysis and data science tools like R ,PYTHONand business inteligence tools
it allows easy manipulation and identification of data

6,Hiding large dataset

Sql is optimised for handiling large voliumes of data effiency

7,Data agregation and summarisation

8,Data security and intergrity

9,support for Advance Analysis

10,Real time data processing
SQL is used in real time dataprocessing and analyticsthrough tools like Apache fink

11, Data warehousing

12, ETL process
13, Business Inteligence


Database tables are refered to us relation
the columns of atabile is Atributes or feilds
Rows are refered as tuple or records



Types of key
primary key : entry of atable is Unique value
Foreign key: one tables primary key when it added to another table then it is called Foriegn key.
CompositeKey: Multiple column connected key
Unique key: null value possible for one time


data type
char
varchar
int
bolean
float
date
date time

Types of language
data definition language :DDL Create ,Alter and drop
data manipulationlanguage: Select, Isert, update, Delete
data control language: Grant, Revoke
transaction control language: Commit ,rollback,savepoint

SQL commands are grouped into four main categories based on their function. 

Data Definition Language (DDL)
DDL commands are used to **define or modify database structures like tables, views, and indexes. They manage the schema of the database.
`CREATE`: Used to create a new database object (e.g., `CREATE TABLE students`).
ALTER: Used to modify the structure of an existing object (e.g., `ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN age INT`).
`DROP`: Used to delete an existing database object (e.g., `DROP TABLE students`).

Data Manipulation Language (DML)


DML commands are used to **manage data within database objects**. They are responsible for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting records.
SELECT`: Retrieves data from a database (e.g., `SELECT * FROM students`).
INSERT: Adds new rows of data to a table (e.g., `INSERT INTO students (name) VALUES ('Alice')`).
UPDATE: Modifies existing data within a table (e.g., `UPDATE students SET age = 20 WHERE name = 'Alice'`).
DELETE`: Deletes rows from a table (e.g., `DELETE FROM students WHERE name = 'Alice'`).



 Data Control Language (DCL)

DCL commands are used to **manage user permissions and access rights** to the database. They control who can perform what actions on the data.
GRANT`: Gives specific privileges to a user or role (e.g., `GRANT SELECT ON students TO user1`).
REVOKE: Removes previously granted privileges from a user or role (e.g., `REVOKE SELECT ON students FROM user1`).

Transaction Control Language (TCL)

TCL commands are used to **manage transactions in a database**. A transaction is a single logical unit of work that can consist of multiple SQL statements.
COMMIT: Saves all changes made during the current transaction permanently to the database.
`ROLLBACK: Undoes all changes since the last `COMMIT` or `SAVEPOINT`, reverting the database to its previous state.
SAVEPOINT`: Creates a temporary marker within a transaction that you can roll back to later without affecting the entire transaction.
